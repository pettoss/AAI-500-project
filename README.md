# Name of the Selected Dataset:
Healthcare Dataset for Age vs Gender Analysis

# Description of the Selected Dataset:
**Data Source:** Kaggle (provided by Prasad22)

**Number of Variables:** The dataset comprises multiple variables, including age, gender, and various health-related attributes.

**Size of Dataset:** The dataset includes several hundred entries, making it suitable for statistical analysis and machine learning modeling.

# Content Overview/Data Dictionary:
**Age:** The dataset contains entries for individuals across a wide age range, allowing for detailed analysis of healthcare usage at different life stages.

**Gender:** Data includes both male and female entries, facilitating gender-based comparisons in healthcare utilization.

**Health Attributes:** Variables related to health conditions, treatments, and outcomes are included, providing a comprehensive view of the healthcare landscape.

**Multi-category Classification:** The dataset supports multi-category classification problems, enabling the development of predictive models to classify health outcomes based on age and gender.

# Questions and Hypotheses
**- Trends Analysis:** How do healthcare utilization patterns vary across different age groups and genders?

**- Disparities Identification:** Are there any significant disparities in healthcare access and outcomes between different genders and age groups?

**- Predictive Modeling:** Can we predict the occurrence of certain medical conditions based on patient demographics and other health attributes?

# Analysis, Visualization, and Modeling
- **Data Analysis:** Descriptive statistics to summarize the data and understand central tendencies and dispersions.
- **Data Visualization:**
   - Histograms and count plots for age and gender distributions.
   - Bar plots and stacked bar plots for analyzing the distribution of medical conditions and blood types by gender and age groups.
 - **Modeling Work:**
   - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models to predict the occurrence of cancer.
   - Confusion matrices to evaluate model performance.
   - Age and gender group analyses to visualize model performance.
     
# Roadblocks and Challenges
- Addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Balancing precision and recall, especially for minority classes in the target variable.
- Managing computational efficiency for training models on a relatively large dataset.
